    <h1>School Projects</h1>
    <h2>Website</h2>
    <p> This was a project done for class where we made websites using HTML. I made the website with the main goal of informing the reader about the game series starcraft. <a href ="https://github.com/Themarineguy101/TestSite/tree/master/Starcraft%20series%20website%20-%20Copy">Link to the code in github is here</a></p>
    <img src="Website image.PNG" alt="image of functioning Website" class="responsive">
    <h2>Card Game</h2>
    <p> This was a project done for class where we made, using netbeans to make a game where one guesses if the next card would be a higher or lower value. <a href ="https://github.com/Themarineguy101/TestSite/tree/master/CardGameTesting">Link to the code in github is here</a></p>

<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>Java Calculator</h2>
    <p>This is a calculator I developed using java, capable of a decent amount of operations, soch as log, square root, squared, the basic operations, Cosh, and some other operations.<a href ="https://github.com/Themarineguy101/TestSite/tree/master/Java_Project_Scientific_Calculator">Link to the code in github is here</a></p>

<h2>Video Game Factions</h2>
    <p>This is a database I made which holdes three lonked tables that hold game, mod, and faction data, developed through Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. <a href ="https://github.com/Themarineguy101/TestSite/tree/master/Table_Test">Link to the code in github is here</a>. <a href ="https://databasedeploy.azurewebsites.net/Game/Game">Here is a link that can directly show the contents of said table</a>.</p>
    <img src="Small Snippit of Table.PNG" alt="image of a small part of one of the tables int the project" class="responsive">
<h2>Wizard Wars</h2>
<p>This is a top down shooting game I made using Unity and C#, made mainly for local 2 player vs, and a single player challenge mode. Besides the music, sound effects, and the base movement script for the characters I largely done it through research and experimentation, making a lightbased shooter with a variety of power-ups revolving around the use of light to both find and hide. <a href ="https://github.com/Themarineguy101/TestSite/tree/master/Script">Link to the C# files for the game,</a> though not all of the code is incorperated into the project, like the bounce projectile. <a href ="https://github.com/Themarineguy101/TestSite/tree/master/WizardDuelGame.zip">Here is a link to the compressed game files that you can download</a>, then extract to play on the computer.</p>
